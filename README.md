# Orange Weather
A privacy respecting and ad-free weather application for iOS. This app does not collect, store, or share any of your personal data. Weather information is provided by [Apple WeatherKit](https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/) and is made possible by [these third parties](https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/data-source-attribution/).

Frost Alerts are made possible by <a href="https://open-meteo.com/">Weather data from Open-Meteo.com</a>

## Privacy Policy 
This app registers a device token that is unique to your device. This token is collected in order to register with Apple Push Notification Services (APNs), in case you would like to opt-in to frost alerts for a specific location(s). A device token is registered on the developer's server even if you do not opt-in to frost alerts. Should you opt-in to frost alerts, each location you request alerts for will be associated with your device token and visible to the developer. 

A device token is similar to what is shown below, and does not uniquely identify you as a person, but only your device:
